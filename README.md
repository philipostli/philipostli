## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Philip Ã˜stli and I am a senior DevOps engineer working as a consultant at Redpill Linpro @ Oslo, Norway. I'm apassionate about coding and is currently working on Python and React webapps in Azure Kubernetes Services. I have previously created [Android apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loggbokapp&pcampaignid=web_share) using Kotlin, Flutter, React Native and OpenShift. I have several years behind me working with Microsoft .NET tech stack including C#, MSSQL, Xamarin and Power BI. I also have interests in smart home technology and have contributed on a few apps for Athom Homey, both professionally and in private.
I thoroughly follow coding best practices concidering security first, and readability/docuemntation second, which also correlates with my one true religion which is Free Open Source Software!
